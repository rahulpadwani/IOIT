# Cherry Tone – Internet of Intelligent Things 🤖🌐

A government-funded project focused on integrating facial recognition with IoT communication using edge and cloud computing.  
Built on Raspberry Pi, the system enables intelligent collaboration between heterogeneous IoT devices through a centralized server.

## 🔍 Overview

Cherry Tone allows real-time facial recognition to control and automate tasks across connected devices.  
Once a face is recognized, specific actions are triggered – such as unlocking smart locks, turning on appliances, or sending alerts.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🎯 Real-time facial recognition with OpenCV and Python
- 📡 Central server to facilitate communication between devices
- 🔐 Identity-based access and task execution
- 🌩️ Cloud integration for remote data processing
- 🧾 Published research and government support (Gujarat, India)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Raspberry Pi** (Edge device)
- **Python**, **OpenCV**
- **Flask** (Backend server)
- **Socket.IO / MQTT** for device communication
- **MySQL** for face-ID mapping
- **Cloud hosting** (Firebase / AWS EC2)
